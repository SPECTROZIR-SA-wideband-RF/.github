## Overview

**SPECTROZIR SA** is a Windows application for real-time RF spectrum analysis up to multi-GHz bands. It visualizes power-vs-frequency and waterfall views, supports popular SDR front-ends (HackRF, TinySA, ADALM-Pluto, bladeRF, etc.), and streamlines interference hunting, band occupancy checks, and drone-signal detection for labs, field teams, and hobbyists.

## Key Features

- 📡 **Device support:** HackRF One, TinySA (Base/Ultra), ADALM-Pluto, bladeRF and others.  
- ⚡ **Fast scanning:** wide sweeps with real-time spectrum + waterfall visualization.  
- 🔎 **Signal tools:** peak hold, markers, max/avg traces, squelch and threshold masks.  
- 🧭 **Band presets:** Wi-Fi 2.4/5 GHz, ISM 433/868/915 MHz, LTE bands, GNSS views.  
- 🧰 **Capture & export:** snapshots, CSV/JSON logs, report bundles for audits.  
- 🎛 **Profiles:** device/range templates, custom color maps and dynamic range.

## Advanced Capabilities

- 🛰 **Interference hunting:** fast peak search, marker delta, heat-style occupancy.  
- 🧪 **Offline review:** record IQ-free level data for later inspection.  
- 🧩 **Extensibility:** plugin hooks for device control and scripted scans (CLI).  
- 🧭 **Geared for newcomers:** minimal setup; sensible defaults for each SDR.

## Use Cases

- RF site surveys and band-usage audits.  
- Wi-Fi/ISM troubleshooting (co-channel, adjacent-channel issues).  
- Drone-link visibility checks in 2.4/5.8/915 MHz bands.  
- Classroom demos of spectrum concepts and modulation signatures.  
- Field interference logging with portable SDRs.

## Quick Start

1. Download and install **SPECTROZIR SA** from the official site.  
2. Connect your SDR (e.g., HackRF/TinySA) and confirm drivers are loaded.  
3. Launch the app → select device → pick a band preset.  
4. Press **Start** to view spectrum + waterfall; add markers and masks.  
5. Save a snapshot or export a log/report for documentation.

## Tips

- Use USB 3.0 and shielded cables to reduce self-noise.  
- Start with narrow span to identify peaks, then widen for context.  
- Apply peak-hold with threshold masks to spot intermittent emitters.
